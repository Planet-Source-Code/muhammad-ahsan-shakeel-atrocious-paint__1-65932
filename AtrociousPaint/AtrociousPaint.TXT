The cab file for your application has been built as 'D:\VisualBasic Source Codes\AtrociousPaint\Setup\AtrociousPaint.CAB'.

There is also a batch file in the support directory (D:\VisualBasic Source Codes\AtrociousPaint\Setup\Support\AtrociousPaint.BAT) that will allow you to recreate the cab file in case you make changes to some of the files.
